This folder contains the .o and .so files needed to run ORBITVIS in CMODE 1 or CMODE 2. Simply drag this folder into your ORBITVIS directory, then specify where ORBITVIS can find the .o and .so files in the .config file. 

By default, the files were placed in the objects subfolder, so the objects key in the .config file should probably have to-orbitvis/objects as its value.
