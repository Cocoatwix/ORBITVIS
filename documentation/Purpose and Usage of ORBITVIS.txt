The purpose of this program is to visualise the orbits of linear cellular automata--either vectors being repeatedly multiplied by some matrix, mod some modulus, or matrices being multiplied by themselves mod some modulus. It does so by representing the set of all vectors/matrices mod some modulus as coloured squares on a grid. The colours then change depending on the setup to showcase how the vectors/matrices behave. To run the program, run orbitvis.py directly. Make sure you have PyGame set up with your Python distribution (PyGame 1.9.6 was used for testing, though other versions should also work).

The main form of interaction with the program is by pressing the arrow keys, which perform different actions depending on the CMODE that's active (see below). These tasks can take a long time depending on the automata being visualised.

The S key takes a screenshot of the current plane and places it in the working directory.

In order to run ORBITVIS in its current form, LINCELLAUT's object files, an update matrix file, and a shared library file all must be placed in ORBITVIS' directory, and the path to the folder containing these files must be specified in the .config file. Otherwise, ORBITVIS won't be able to perform any of the calculations required for generating its visualisations.

There are multiple different colouring modes to use with ORBITVIS, each having specific use cases. They can be toggled by setting the "colormode" key in the .config file (see .config specs file). Information regarding these colour modes can be found in the "Colour Modes" documentation file.

For iterall, mode 0 means the off-diagonal entries of the update matrix are changed whenever the arrow keys are pressed. Up/down changes the bottom left entry, while left/right will change the top right. The diagonal entries are incremented across each screen through all possible values.

For iterall, mode 1 means the diagonal entries of the update matrix are changed whenever the arrow keys are pressed. Up/down changes the top left entry, while left/right will change the bottom right. The off-diagonal entries are incremented across each screen through all possible values.

There are three different computation modes for traversing orbits. These can be toggled with the "cmode" key in the .config file. 

"iterplane" makes use of LINCELLAUT's codebase to generate vector orbits on the fly. The modulus used must be manually input into ORBITVIS' .config file (see LINCELLAUT's documentation on .config files for more info). The right arrow key increases the iteration count by 1, while the left arrow key decreases the iteration count by one.

"iterstate" calculates orbits on the fly like iterplane, but the vectors' current states are saved each generation. This way, only one iteration has to be calculated when incrementing or decrementing iterations. The left arrow button resets to iteration #0, while the right arrow key behaves the same as it did for iterplane.
For large moduli, iterstate should perform faster than iterplane at the cost of using more memory to store the current states of each vector. For smaller moduli, iterstate is probably slower than iterplane due to the increased time accessing Python lists.

"iterall" is a completely different visualisation from the previous two. Iterall calculates the transient and cycle lengths for ALL possible matrices, and represents each matrix's values as a coloured square. The arrow keys for this mode are used to change the range of matrices displayed to the screen. By default, the diagonal entries of the update matrix are incremented on each screen as you move along the orthogonal axes. The off diagonal entries remain fixed on each screen. Pressing the up/down keys will change the bottom left entry of the matrix, while the left/right keys will change the top right entry. This behaviour changes depending on the COLORMODE. 
Unlike iterplane and iterstate, iterall behaves the same, regardless of the COLORMODE (currently).

Iterstate and iterall allow you to gain some insights into the vectors/matrices you're looking at. If HOVERMODE is enabled (see documentation for .config file), then clicking on any of the vectors on screen will print out info regarding the vector you clicked, such as which vectors landed on it that iteration, where the vector travelled to that iteration, etc.

If CAPTUREMODE is enabled (see documentation for .config file), ORBITVIS will generate every possible plane with the given settings and save them as screenshots. ORBITVIS knows to automatically stop generating screenshots when the vectors fall into a cycle. If, however, the user only wants to generate a few screenshots and not the entire cycle, the "maxcaptures" key can be set in the .config file 
CAPTUREMODE currently does not work with iterall mode.
