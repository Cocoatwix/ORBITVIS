The following lists the key-value pairs which can be used for ORBITVIS' .config file. Unlike LINCELLAUT's .config files, ORBITVIS' .config file has no default limit on the length of keys or values. For a more complete description of .config files, see LINCELLAUT's documentation.

mod : This key specifies the modulus used in the given linear cellular automaton. When CMODE is set to 0, this key does nothing. When CMODE is set to 1, this key is mandatory for ORBITVIS to run (otherwise, the program has no way to know how big to make the vector grid). This key expect an integer as its value.
